    <h2>Vote By Mail Now</h2>
    <p>Want to vote by mail? You better get on it! First of all, <a href="https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/" target="_blank" title="make sure you're registered to vote">make sure you're registered to vote</a> and all your information is up to date. Even if you've voted in the past you may not have an active voter registration (read more about why here), so it is best to double check your voter registration.</p>
    <p>Once you've done that, request your mail in ballot <u>AS SOON AS POSSIBLE</u>. When your ballot arrives be sure to read the instructions on how to fill it out properly. It also doesn't hurt to <u>familiarize yourself with any voting guidelines</u> issued by your state before casting your vote. You want to do everything within your power to make sure your ballot abides by the law and arrives well before the deadline, <u>otherwise your mail in vote won't get counted</u> (read more about how to prevent this)!</p>
    <p>Due to overwhelming interest in mail-in voting and a lack of resources around counting mail-in ballots, it is <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> you drop off or mail your ballot well before any election deadline. The prevailing advice right now is: "<u>mail your ballot back at least <strong>2 weeks</strong> before Election Day</u>" though some states may allow you to postmark even sooner. Sending back your ballot well before Election Day helps ensure your vote will count (read about why some mail in ballots get thrown out). View the table under Voting Deadlines to see when your earliest (and latest) vote by mail opportunity will be.</p>
