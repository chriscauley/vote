    <p>Voting matters, now more than ever. And guess what? For the vast majority of Americans, <strong>casting your vote is easier than it has ever been</strong>. You may have heard about "mail-in voting", or "absentee voting" (pretty much the same thing!) recently and have some questions. This webpage is dedicated to answering those questions, enabling you to vote safely from home, and helping you to make sure <u>your vote will count</u> on Election Day.</p>
    <p>Though voting is one of the few opportunities we Americans get to have an influence on the direction of this country, there are dark forces out there working to make it more difficult for you to cast your ballot in November (read how here). It was already hard enough to vote in person (who schedules anything on a Tuesday?), but until Election Day becomes a national holiday, and until COVID-19 becomes a thing of the past, casting your vote by mail is the best option you have to make your voice heard.</p>
